AboutAbout
I’m a Cloud & Platform Engineer who focuses on building the foundations that make software delivery easier for everyone. Over the last few years, I’ve worked on shared platforms and automation that allow teams to deploy applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure or compliance requirements. Most of my work has been in creating tools, reusable workflows, and reliable shared services. Today, I’m applying these skills in the autonomous and self-driving space, helping to shape the platforms that support one of the most challenging and exciting areas of technology enabling teams to move faster with confidence.I’m a Cloud & Platform Engineer who focuses on building the foundations that make software delivery easier for everyone.
